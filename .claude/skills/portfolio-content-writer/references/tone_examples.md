# Hey, I'm Alex! 👋

I build things that solve real problems for real people. When I'm not deep in code, you'll probably find me hiking with my dog, experimenting with sourdough recipes, or nerding out about the latest JavaScript frameworks.

## My Journey
Started coding at 12 because I wanted to build a gaming website for my friends. Fast forward 10 years, and I'm still building things that make people's lives better - just slightly more complex ones!

The best part of this job? Seeing someone use something I built and having it genuinely make their day easier. That's the magic that keeps me coding.

## What I Love Building

- **Team Collaboration Tools**: Because great things happen when people work together seamlessly
- **Performance Optimizations**: There's something satisfying about making things lightning fast

## Let's Connect!
I'm always up for chatting about:
- Interesting tech challenges
- Startup ideas (I have a few brewing!)
- Good hiking trails around the Bay Area
- The perfect sourdough technique (it's a work in progress)

Coffee's on me if you want to talk shop or swap stories! ☕

**Blog Post Introduction**:
```
Ever had that moment where you're staring at a production error at 2 AM, wondering why you chose this career? Yeah, me too. Last week, I spent three hours debugging a missing semicolon that took down our entire checkout process.

But you know what? Those moments make us better developers. And I'm here to share some battle-tested strategies that have saved my sanity (and my sleep schedule) more times than I can count.

Let's talk about building robust error handling that doesn't make you want to throw your laptop out the window...
